Mrs. Esputa quickly fetched one of her husbands white shirts. But when Philip put it on, she began to exclaim, Oh, dear! Gracious! The shirt was so large that Philip was almost lost in it. Hastily Mrs. Esputa found a box of pins. In a twinkling, her nimble fingers pinned enough tucks in the shirt to make it fit Philip. They both heaved a big sigh of relief when the job was finished." , "The Airbus A380 is the largest passenger plane that has ever been built. It can carry more passengers and cargo than any other airplane and its designers say that it uses less fuel and make less noise. The A 380 is a giant in the skies. Its wings span about 80 meters and it has a length of 73 meters. When filled with passengers the A 380 weighs over 500 000 kg. It has three decks - two passenger decks and one for cargo." , "When the man first began to think, he asked himself the deepest of all questions a question which you have undoubtedly asked yourself many times: What is the meaning of Life? What is it all about? Where are we all going? What drives men ever forward to work and worry? And now there's this other big question-a newer question which is beginning to force itself into our notice. One that is not ages old. That has not been with us since man first began to think." , "Cars are automobiles that can transport people. It is the main means of travelling for hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Cars have changed the way we live probably more than any other invention in history. At first only a few people had cars but after a while more and more people bought them because they improved the way people lived. Farmers with cars were able to bring their products to places that were farther away." , ];
